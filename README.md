the jsonparser has functionality to parse json string to a student and parse a student to jsonstring.
both functionlities are tested and was developed using TDD.


### Tic-tac-toe
There were some late problems doing the TDD process of the game, where the unit test was written wrong, by them not being able to "fail".
we tried to fix this but The unit test could not retrieve the value of the 2d array, which we used as our playing field for the game.
There is a simple final game, but unfortunately, it was not made entirely with TDD.
The game can be found in the Tic Tac Toe folder, and the messy test can be found in the project folder under test. :)
